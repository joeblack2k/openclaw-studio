# Skills in OpenClaw + OpenClaw Studio

This document explains skills from first principles, how they work in the OpenClaw runtime (`~/openclaw`), and how OpenClaw Studio currently exposes them in UX.

It is intended as design context for rethinking the Skills UX.

## 1) Why skills exist (first principles)

Skills are the mechanism OpenClaw uses to give agents reusable operational know-how without hardcoding that know-how into core runtime logic.

At a product level, a skill is:
- A unit of capability guidance (`SKILL.md`) that teaches an agent how to perform a job.
- A gated unit of readiness (only available when required binaries/env/config/OS are satisfied).
- A portable package format compatible with AgentSkills (`agentskills.io`) so skill content can be authored and shared outside a single product.

Without skills, every workflow instruction would need to live in prompts, app code, or ad hoc user messages. Skills create a middle layer: structured capability packs that are discoverable, filterable, and enforceable.

## 2) AgentSkills.io context

OpenClaw intentionally uses AgentSkills-compatible `SKILL.md` structure and semantics.

Why this matters:
- Interoperability: skills can move between ecosystems that understand AgentSkills.
- Community/network effects: external skill ecosystems (for OpenClaw specifically, ClawHub) can be leveraged instead of reinventing proprietary formats.
- UX consistency: users can reason about “a skill folder with `SKILL.md` + metadata gates” instead of app-specific abstractions.

OpenClaw adds product-specific metadata under `metadata.openclaw` (install specs, gating fields, primary env key, etc.) while keeping the base skill shape compatible.

## 3) Skill object model

A skill is loaded from a directory containing `SKILL.md` with frontmatter.

Minimum frontmatter:
- `name`
- `description`

Important optional fields used by OpenClaw:
- `metadata.openclaw.always`
- `metadata.openclaw.skillKey`
- `metadata.openclaw.primaryEnv`
- `metadata.openclaw.os`
- `metadata.openclaw.requires.{bins, anyBins, env, config}`
- `metadata.openclaw.install[]`
- `user-invocable`
- `disable-model-invocation`
- `command-dispatch`, `command-tool`, `command-arg-mode`

In runtime, this becomes a normalized `SkillEntry`:
- Raw skill (`name`, `description`, `source`, file paths)
- Parsed frontmatter
- Resolved OpenClaw metadata
- Invocation policy flags

## 4) Where skills come from (discovery + precedence)

OpenClaw merges multiple sources into one effective skill set.

Current merge precedence in code (lowest -> highest):
1. `skills.load.extraDirs` and plugin-contributed skill dirs (`source: openclaw-extra`)
2. Bundled skills (`openclaw-bundled`)
3. Managed/global local skills (`~/.openclaw/skills`, `openclaw-managed`)
4. Personal agents skills (`~/.agents/skills`, `agents-skills-personal`)
5. Project agents skills (`<workspace>/.agents/skills`, `agents-skills-project`)
6. Workspace skills (`<workspace>/skills`, `openclaw-workspace`)

Name conflicts are resolved by “last writer wins” according to this order.

## 5) Eligibility and gating model

Eligibility is not just “is this skill installed.” It is computed every load/snapshot using:
- Per-skill disable (`skills.entries.<skillKey>.enabled === false`)
- Bundled allowlist (`skills.allowBundled`) for bundled skills only
- Runtime requirements:
  - `requires.bins` (all required)
  - `requires.anyBins` (at least one)
  - `requires.env`
  - `requires.config`
  - `os`
- Remote node eligibility (macOS node bin probing can satisfy certain requirements)
- `always: true` short-circuiting requirement failures

Status output carries:
- `eligible` / `blocked`
- structured `missing` reasons
- `configChecks` with `{ path, satisfied }` (not secret values)
- install options derived from metadata

## 6) Agent-level filtering semantics

OpenClaw has a separate per-agent skill filter via `agents.list[].skills`:
- Missing `skills` key: all discovered skills are allowed
- `skills: []`: no skills allowed
- `skills: ["a", "b"]`: allowlist mode

This filter is normalized and passed into snapshot generation as `skillFilter`.

In practice this is the key UX distinction:
- Discovery/readiness is global + workspace-derived.
- “Can this specific agent use it?” is per-agent allowlist.

## 7) Snapshot + prompt lifecycle

Skills are snapshotted into session state (`skillsSnapshot`) to avoid re-scanning every turn.

Snapshot contains:
- prebuilt prompt block
- lightweight skill metadata (`name`, `primaryEnv`, required env names)
- normalized `skillFilter`
- resolved skills list
- version

Lifecycle:
1. First turn/new session builds snapshot.
2. File watcher / remote-node events bump snapshot version.
3. Later turns refresh snapshot only if version is newer.
4. Prompt injection uses snapshot prompt when present.

Watcher scope includes:
- workspace `skills/`
- workspace `.agents/skills`
- `~/.openclaw/skills`
- `~/.agents/skills`
- configured extra dirs
- plugin skill dirs

Watcher monitors `SKILL.md` patterns (not entire trees) and debounces changes.

## 8) Runtime execution behavior

During an agent run:
1. Skill env overrides are applied (`skills.entries.*.env` + `apiKey` mapping to `primaryEnv`).
2. Overrides are sanitized/guarded (dangerous host env keys blocked).
3. Skills prompt is injected.
4. Environment is restored after run.

Invocation behavior:
- `disable-model-invocation: true` keeps skill out of model prompt.
- `user-invocable: true` exposes slash commands.
- Optional direct tool dispatch can bypass model routing.

Sandbox nuance:
- For non-`rw` sandbox workspaces, OpenClaw syncs skills into sandbox workspace (best-effort) so skill files remain accessible.

## 9) Gateway API surface for skills

Core RPC methods:
- `skills.status` -> returns `SkillStatusReport` for an agent workspace.
- `skills.install` -> installs dependencies for a skill install option.
- `skills.update` -> updates `skills.entries.<skillKey>` config (`enabled`, `apiKey`, `env`).
- `skills.bins` -> aggregates required bins across agent workspaces.

Important scope behavior:
- `skills.install` is executed against the default agent workspace (not arbitrary selected agent workspace).
- `skills.update` writes gateway config (`openclaw.json`) and is gateway-wide state mutation.

Security detail:
- `skills.status` exposes config check satisfaction, not raw secret config values.

## 10) OpenClaw Studio UX (current behavior)

### 10.1 Route and navigation model

Studio settings currently live on root route with a query-driven settings mode:
- Canonical settings state is `/?settingsAgentId=<agentId>`.
- `/agents/[agentId]/settings` currently redirects to that query route.

Left nav tabs in settings mode:
- Behavior
- Capabilities
- Skills
- Automations
- Advanced

### 10.2 Skills tab data and interactions

When either `Skills` or `System setup` tab is active and connected, Studio:
1. Calls `skills.status`.
2. Reads current per-agent allowlist from gateway config (`agents.list[].skills`).
3. Renders two distinct settings surfaces:

`Skills` tab (agent-scoped):
- Shows one list focused on “what this agent can use”.
- Per-skill allow toggle (`Skill <name>` switch) for agent access only.
- Simplified status chips (`Ready`, `Setup required`, `Not supported`).
- Search + status filters for scanning.
- Non-ready rows provide `Open System Setup` instead of inline setup actions.

`System setup` tab (gateway-scoped):
- Explicitly states that setup actions affect all agents.
- Shows setup queue and full readiness details.
- Per-skill `Configure` modal with setup/lifecycle actions:
  - install dependencies (`skills.install`)
  - save API key (`skills.update` with `apiKey`)
  - global enable/disable (`skills.update` with `enabled`)
  - remove removable skill directories via Studio remove route
- Supports transition handoff from agent row to preselected skill setup context.

### 10.3 Mutation wiring from Studio

Per-agent access mutations:
- `updateGatewayAgentSkillsAllowlist` in Studio writes `config.set` with retry-on-stale-hash behavior.
- Agent toggles continue to rely on allowlist semantics (`undefined` means all, explicit array means selected-only).

System setup mutations:
- Install -> `skills.install`
- API key save -> `skills.update`
- Remove files -> Studio route `/api/gateway/skills/remove` (local fs or SSH helper)

Removal has strict guards:
- Only specific sources removable (`openclaw-managed`, `openclaw-workspace`).
- Must stay inside allowed root.
- Cannot remove skills root directory.
- Must look like a real skill dir (`SKILL.md` exists).

### 10.4 Scope warning shown in Studio

Studio computes the default agent id and passes install-scope context into the system setup surface.

Current scope copy behavior:
- `Skills` tab copy states controls apply to the current agent.
- `System setup` tab copy states actions apply to all agents.
- Install target caveat (default-agent workspace behavior) is shown in system setup context and setup modal context, where install actions actually occur.

This keeps scope and install-target warnings accurate while minimizing noise in the agent access flow.

## 11) What recent `.agent/done` plans show

Sorted by most recent creation time in `openclaw-studio/.agent/done`, the latest items are mostly bugfix exec plans (streaming, proxy auth, stale config, cron rollback, etc.).

The most recent plan with explicit skills direction is:
- `ui-execplan-stuff.md` (2026-02-20 create time), which intentionally scoped skills as coming-soon during that IA pass.

Additional files with incidental skill mentions:
- `simplify-agent-creation-starter-kits.md`
- `ux-zero-agent-layout-consolidation.md`

Interpretation:
- The current Studio code now has a real Skills tab and mutation flow, but the older IA/doc language still contains “coming soon” assumptions in places.
- For redesign, trust current code behavior over older plan phrasing.

## 12) UX redesign constraints that are not optional

Any redesign should preserve these distinctions:

1. Three separate scopes:
- Agent allowlist scope (`agents.list[].skills`)
- Gateway setup scope (`skills.entries.*`, installs)
- Source/discovery scope (workspace/managed/bundled/extra/plugin)

2. Eligibility vs enablement:
- A skill can be enabled by allowlist but still blocked by missing requirements.
- A skill can be eligible but disabled by agent allowlist.

3. Session-snapshot behavior:
- Skills changes may not appear mid-turn; they apply on next turn/snapshot refresh.

4. Install target caveat:
- Install currently targets default agent workspace context in gateway path.

5. Security posture:
- Secret values should never be exposed in status surfaces.
- Removal must stay bounded to allowed roots and verified skill dirs.

## 13) Practical mental model for reviewing a Skills screenshot

If you hand a screenshot to another LLM for UX feedback, ask it to evaluate on three axes:

1. **Scope clarity**
- Can a user tell what is per-agent vs gateway-wide?

2. **Readiness clarity**
- Can a user tell blocked vs eligible and why?

3. **Action safety**
- Are destructive/setup actions clearly separated from allowlist toggles?

If a design fails any of those axes, users will misconfigure skills even if controls are technically correct.
